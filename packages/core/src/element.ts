/**
 * The universal `Element` primitive and its lineage neighbours (T005).
 *
 * `Element` is the single object model for the whole product (sources, topics,
 * extracts, cards, tasks, concepts, media fragments, synthesis notes). Lineage
 * is sacred: an element knows its `parentId` and `sourceId`, and typed edges in
 * {@link ElementRelation} plus positions in {@link ElementLocation} let a card
 * trace back `card → extract → source location → source metadata → original
 * document context`. These shapes are framework-agnostic (no React/Drizzle/
 * better-sqlite3); `packages/db` mirrors them as the SQLite schema (T006) and
 * `packages/local-db` reads/writes them behind the Electron/IPC boundary (T008).
